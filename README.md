# Business-Analysis-Case-Study

Bank of the United States is a very large corporation that caters for millions of customers of all types, from   individual customers to hedge funds and corporations. The bank’s Global Markets division processes millions of   trades on a daily basis and is constantly seeking higher market share and competitive advantages.


PROBLEM STATEMENT

One of many systems that is used for the Bank’s operations is named Klaxon. Its primary purpose is to enrich 

trades received from multiple systems and pass them down to a myriad of downstream consumers. Here are 

some of the challenges Klaxon is faced with:

 Klaxon is a very aged system and is running on aged technologies. Processing costs are high

 Regulators are making increased demands from the system so Klaxon requires constant updates to meet 

those requirements

 The business requires a lot more data points than what the system was initially designed for. A lot of 

subsystems have been “bolted on” to expand Klaxon’s remit

 The pool of developers that can maintain the application is getting smaller every year

 Klaxon requires multiple manual interventions from system specialists throughout the day

The Bank’s management has appointed you as the new business analyst and has asked that you devise a 

strategy for the future of Klaxon. Prepare a project strategy, timeline and workflow. You should consider the 

following when building your plans: 

 You can select which operations function Klaxon currently serves – i.e., transaction processing, 

settlements, reconciliation, corporate actions, etc.

 You have budget for both Tactical fixes and Strategic work for a multiyear transformation / 

decommission

 You should clarify who your stakeholders are and their roles

 You should Specify what impacts / benefits both your tactical and strategic plans would have on each 

party

 You can use whatever data and metrics you need (Volumes, economic and market conditions…) though 

you should try to make them realistic

 You have a team of strong developers to work with
